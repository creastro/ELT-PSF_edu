# ELT-PSF_edu

ELT-PSF_edu is a simplified, pedagogical version inspired by the professional software used by astronomers to model the JWST's PSFs (WebbPSF tool).
It is design as an educational software tool that can simulate the diffraction effects of the ELT and demonstrate how its optical design influences the resulting image.
